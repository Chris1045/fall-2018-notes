### HTML
Abstract representation -- `<tag>` is not a real HTML tag!

```
<html>
  <head>
    <tag> content </tag>
    <self-closing-tag>
  </head>
  <body>
    <tag attr1="value1" attr2="value2>content </tag>
    <self-closing-tag attr="value1">
    <tag>
      <nested-tag> content </nested-tag>
    </tag>
  </body>
</html>
```
## CSS!
### Introduction to CSS
1. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on the screen.
2. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of **multiple** web pages all at **once**.
3. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files and linked to their respective HTML files like this:

```HTML
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, Gakko!</h1>
      <p>This morning I took the A train from Brooklyn. I didn't get to sit down smh. But I saw a boy with a drum. He looked like he was on his way to marching band practice.</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Abstract CSS Syntax
```
selector {
  property: value;
  property: value;
}
```

### Real CSS examples
```
h1 {
  font-size: 200px;
}

.myClassName {
  color: red;
}

#myId {
  background-image: url("mypic.jpg");
}
```

### The Box Model
![Every HTML element lives in a box like this.](media/thebox.png)

- **Content** — The content of the box, where text and images appear.
- **Padding** — Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.
- **Border** — A border that goes around the padding and content.
- **Margin** —  Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.
