# Welcome to Code Forward fall 2018!
Today we'll get to know each other, take care of a few administrative tasks, start learning about HTML and CSS, and publish our first website!

## Getting started
### Introductions
Let's get to know each other a little bit!
- Name
- A few words about your experience with and interest in coding
- Something you care about (doesn't have to be about programming)
- What you want to learn and build

### Goals for this course
- Learn the fundamentals of creating informational and interactive websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Become comfortable with programmers' tools such as online documentation, the command line, git, text editors, Glitch, and more
- Gain familiarity with some of the diverse people who write code, what they use code for, and why
  - Software industry professionals!
  - Artists!
  - Activists!
  - Scientists and data analysts!
- Produce a final portfolio project you're proud to show off

### Class expectations
- Please be prompt, we only have a short time together!
- Participate in all discussions and complete all assignments to the best of your ability, even when you're not sure about something.
- Help your fellow classmates! No disrespect if they get something wrong -- we all do.

## Introduction to HTML and CSS
Our goal for today is to get our first informational website online using a hosted platform called Glitch. We'll need to sign up for a couple of accounts, create a new project based on the "hello-webpage" starter, and then write some HTML and CSS to make it our own!

### Account signups
- [github.com]()
- [glitch.com]()

### Modeling our page on existing pages
Let's "view source" on freethemny.com and what we notice!
- head and body of an HTML document
- HTML tag syntax: `<tagname attribute="value"> content </tagname>`
- nesting of tags

### Your webpage
Can be the beginnings of a portfolio for yourself, or an informational website about any topic you'd like!

Minimum elements to include:
- A navigation bar
- A `main` tag for the main content
- Text including: a heading tag, a paragraph tag, a list tag with at least two items
- One image, including alt text
- A link to another website
- Some CSS to alter the standard look of the page

More possibilities:
- a header image at the top
- Embed a video from youtube
- Anything else that strikes your fancy!
