# Brief review of last week
Let's check out a few of the projects people submitted last week, and make sure we all remember a few important facts about HTML and CSS.

If your page isn't up here today, it's not because it's not great -- we're only looking at a few projects for the sake of time. Everyone's work will be featured up here in some week!

## Your pages
[Spencer's page](https://calming.glitch.me/)
- How did you get all of the images to be the exact same size?

[Michelle's page](https://flax-output.glitch.me/)
- How did you get the links to be a different color when you hover?
- Let's check out some of the [advanced CSS Michelle used!](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/flax-output?path=style.css:3:0)

[Miles's page](https://kidcoderdev.glitch.me/)
- Let's check out how the audio works!

## Review of good coding practices
- Always indent nested code to the proper level.
- Close tags right after you open them (Glitch helps you with this).
- Fix any errors or warnings the Glitch editor shows you.
- Use names that make sense to help you remember, for example, what your custom CSS class is for.

# Introduction to JavaScript
We still have a lot more to learn about HTML and CSS, but today we're going to start looking at JavaScript, which is the programming language of the Web! Then we'll spend the next few classes learning more about all three, and how to make them work nicely together.

Today, we'll focus on how JavaScript can add interactivity to your web pages.

## A few things JavaScript can do
Open your Chrome developer tools, and find the console. This is one place we can run JavaScript code -- on any page on the web!

### It can make alerts
```javascript
alert("YOOOOOOOOO");
```

### It can print words on the Console
```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

### It can do math
```javascript
1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34
```

### It can modify content
```javascript
document.querySelector('body').textContent = "New Title";
```

We're pretty much telling the browser, "Hey, `document`! Select an `h1`, and change its text to say 'New Title'."

See if you can change the title of the [New York Times food section](https://www.nytimes.com/section/food?WT.nav=page&action=click&contentCollection=Food&module=HPMiniNav&pgtype=Homepage&region=TopBar).

You'll need to relaunch Developer Tools for this specific webpage.

###  It can change styles
In other words, we can write CSS with JavaScript!

```javascript
document.querySelector('div').style.background = "red";
```

We're telling the browser, "Hey, `document`! Select a `div`, and change its `style` (its CSS) so its `background` property is `red`."


>Important note: JavaScript syntax is slightly different from CSS. For example:

>```CSS
>body {
>	text-transform: uppercase; 
>}
>``` 

> accomplishes the same thing as 

>```Javascript
>document.querySelector('body').style.textTransform = "uppercase";
>```
> The key difference is `text-transform` in CSS vs `textTransform` in JS
> We call stuffLikeThis "camelCase", and stuff-like-this "hyphen-case" or  "caterpillar-case" or "dash-case" or "kebab-case". (Don't ask me why!)

# Things to remember
- Always add a script tag so your HTML page is running your JavaScript code:
```HTML
<script src="script.js"></script>
```
- If you put the script tag in the head, add the `defer` attribute so your code runs after your page loads, not before:
```HTML
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
```
- JavaScript is less forgiving than HTML or CSS. A misplaced period or comma can ruin everything! Pay close attention to detail. You'll get better at quickly spotting mistakes the more you practice reading and writing code.
